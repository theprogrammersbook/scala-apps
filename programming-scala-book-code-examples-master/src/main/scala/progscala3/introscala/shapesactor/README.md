# README for package "shapesactor"

This example originally appeared in the first and second editions of the book, in package `shapes`, but I decided it was too much to introduce so soon. Hence, the `shapes` package has a simplified example and this one is left for people already familiar with Akka who might want to play with it. A more extensive Akka example is in the _Concurrency_ chapter.
